I am a graduate student at the __University of Colorado at Boulder(CU Boulder)__ studying __Electrical Engineering__ with a focus on Control theory and Robotics. My interests lie in the field of __Multi-agent robotics__, in all aspects, control, state-estimation and decision making(path-planning). My current research work reflects work in formation control of robots and motion planning. In the future I aspire to deploy solutions on cloud robotic fleets.

Before joining CU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Instrumentation and Control engineering at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology(Delhi University), where I spent time working on smallsats, mobile robots, optimisation algorithms and process control. After my undergraduate, I spent an year working on autonomous vehicles on the [ALIVE project](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive) at IIIT Delhi as a research assistant in the planning and controls team.
